params:
frequency
sfb distance
is_scissor
finger
row

Todo:
make class for mapping and make class for record processing

make sure ngrams are split into their respective layouts, make sure correctness is normalized for string matching as well
make a way of storing data that labels the WPM of surrounding text -- normalize data to be n digits -- sort by WPM first
WPM needs to be set as a separate label

layout frequency normalized_ngram sorted{(WPM duration)*}

graph each category
angle too :))
make colors that work well enough for graphing

maybe log(freq)\*sum(binaries_and_their_coeffs) + a\*sum(binaries_and_their_coeffs)

explore k-fold cross validation
